1.)Chatroom: The classic chatroom example -- reproduced for reference


2.)ChatroomC: Each clients calls a function (send_msg, from the Waldo file) 1000 times
-Calling the Waldo function send_msg triggers a sequence (SeqSendMSG)
-Sequence body is empty -- calling the sequence doesn't actually do anything


3.)ChatroomD: Very similar to chatroomC
-Added connected_callback thread, which starts once a connection is created


4.)ChatroomE: Very similar to chatroomD
-Added signalling (adding to the queue) but not service_signalling (removing from queue)


5.)ChatroomF: Very similar to chatroomD
-Added service_signalling (removing from queue) but not signalling (adding to the queue)
