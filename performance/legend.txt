1.)-Server calls a function through signalling 10,000 times
-Calling the function does not actually do anything
-Only one endpoint - server

2.)-Calling the function creates a range from 0 to num (equals 1 in this case)

3.)-Calling the function iterates over the range 0 to num (which is 1 in this case)

4.)-Calling the function signals a single time using display_msg_func, which sends a message (but doesn't do anything with it)
