1.)The classic chatroom example -- reproduced for reference


2.)-Added signalling (adding to the queue) but not service_signalling (removing from queue)


3.)-Added connected_callback thread, which starts once a connection is created


4.)-Calling the Waldo function send_msg triggers a sequence (SeqSendMSG)
-Sequence body is empty -- calling the sequence doesn't actually do anything


5.)-Calling the Waldo function send_msg does not trigger any further events
