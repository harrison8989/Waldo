1.)-Server calls a function through signalling 10,000 times
-Calling the function does not actually do anything
-Only one endpoint - server

2.)-Calling the function does simple variable manipulation

3.)-Calling the function signals a single time using display_msg_func, which sends a message (but doesn't do anything with it)

4.)-Calling the function signals nothing_func which does absolutely nothing

5.)-Calling the function signals display_msg_func twice

6.)-Calling the function signals display_msg_func thrice

7.)-Calling the function creates a range from 0 to num (equals 1 in this case)

8.)-Calling the function iterates over the range 0 to num (which is 1 in this case)

9.)-Calling the function does basic variable manipulation within a for loop

10.)-Calling the function signals display_msg_func while also creating an empty for loop

11.)-Calling the function calls signal within the for loop (but it loops only once)

12.)-Calling the function creates a range from 0 to num (equals 1 in this case)

13.)-Calling the function iterates over the range 0 to num (which is 1 in this case)

14.)-Calling the function does basic variable manipulation within a for loop

15.)-Calling the function signals display_msg_func while also creating an empty for loop

16.)-Calling the function calls signal within the for loop (but it loops only once)
